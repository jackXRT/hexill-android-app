<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

indefinitely for legal, security, and analytical purposes.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Hexill employs reasonable security measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, misuse, 
or loss. However, no system is completely secure. By using Hexill, you acknowledge that you provide 
data at your own risk, and Hexill cannot guarantee 100% security. You agree not to hold us liable 
for any breach, attack, leak, or unauthorized access to your information.
</p>

<h2>6. User Rights</h2>

Depending on jurisdiction, you may have certain rights (access, correction, deletion, objection). 
However, Hexill reserves the right to limit, delay, or deny any such requests if they interfere 
with business operations, security protocols, or technical feasibility. 
Submitting a request does not guarantee compliance.
</p>

<h2>7. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>
Hexill uses cookies, tracking pixels, and other technologies to monitor behavior. 
By using our services, you agree to the placement and reading of such tools on your devices. 
Disabling cookies may break functionality and Hexill will not be responsible for resulting issues.
</p>

<h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Your information may be transferred, processed, and stored in any country where we or our partners operate. 
You consent to such transfers regardless of differing privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
</p>

<h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>

We are not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of third parties. 
Your interactions with third-party services are at your sole risk.

</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

Revisions will be effective immediately upon posting. 
Continued use of Hexill after changes means you accept the updated policy.
